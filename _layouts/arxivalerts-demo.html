        <b>Abstract:</b> 
        Understanding competing instabilities in systems with correlated fermions remains one of the holy grails of modern condensed matter physics. Among the fermionic lattice models used to this effect, the extended Hubbard model occupies a prime place due to the potential relevance of its repulsive and attractive versions for both electronic materials and artificial systems. Using the recently introduced multi-channel fluctuating field approach, we address the interplay of charge density wave, $s$-wave superconductivity, and phase separation fluctuations in the attractive extended Hubbard model. Despite of the fact that this model has been intensively studied for decades, our novel approach has allowed us to identify a novel phase that is characterised by the coexistence of $s$-wave superconductivity and phase separation. Our findings resonate with previous observations of interplaying phase separation and superconducting phases in electronic systems, most importantly in high-temperature superconductors.

        <b>Abstract:</b> 
        Systems with strong electronic Coulomb correlations often display rich phase diagrams exhibiting different ordered phases involving spin, charge, or orbital degrees of freedom. The theoretical description of the interplay of the corresponding collective fluctuations giving rise to this phenomenology remains however a tremendous challenge. Here, we introduce a multi-channel extension of the recently developed fluctuating field approach to competing collective fluctuations in correlated electron systems. The method is based on a variational optimization of a trial action that explicitly contains the order parameters of the leading fluctuation channels. It gives direct access to the free energy of the system, facilitating the distinction between stable and meta-stable phases of the system. We apply our approach to the extended Hubbard model in the weak to intermediate coupling regime where we find it to capture the interplay of competing charge density wave and antiferromagnetic fluctuations with qualitative agreement with more computationally expensive methods. The multi-channel fluctuation field approach thus offers a promising new route for a numerically cheap treatment of the interplay between collective fluctuations in large systems.
