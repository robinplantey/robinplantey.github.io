My research is in the field of theoretical particle physics. I study models with extended scalar sectors such as multi-Higgs-doublets models. In particular I 
try to relate the mathematical structure, for instance discrete symmetries, of these models to the physical phenomena they can describe, for instance CP 
violation.  
You can check out my academic track [here](/cv/).
