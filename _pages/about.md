I am currently a PhD candidate in theoretical physics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). When I'm not busy trying to improve our 
[theoretical description of elementary particles](/research/), I write [fun and sometimes useful programs](/projects/).

Abstract, technical and mind-bending are keywords which tend to describe my interests. I am a linux evangelist, avid chess player and wanna-be shred guitarist 
interested in blockchain technology and cybersecurity. Feel free to get in touch!
