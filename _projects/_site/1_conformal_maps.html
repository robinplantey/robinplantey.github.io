<h2 id="what-is-a-conformal-transformation">What is a conformal transformation?</h2>

<p>Suppose you wanted to draw a map of the earth on a sheet of paper. Doing so necessarily introduces distorsions in distances and shapes. Conformal 
transformations are transformations that locally preserve angles (and therefore shapes) but not necessarily distances.</p>

<p>In 2 dimensions, conformal transformations correspond to analytic functions ( f )</p>
