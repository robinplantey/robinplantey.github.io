<h2 id="arxiv-alerts">Arxiv Alerts?</h2>
<p>Arxiv Alerts lets you keep track of any authors research. You define a list of authors that you would like to follow and the program will send you a desktop 
notification whenever they submit a new article on ArXiv. It is a small Python program that I initially wrote to be notified about my friends’ new 
publications since ArXiv doesn’t have a way to follow individual authors.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<p>For each author in your subscription list, the program does a search on arxiv, parses the results and retrieves information related to any new publications, if 
there are any since the last check. If there are new articles, it prepares a summary that you can open via a desktop notification.</p>
